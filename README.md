# ldapr

## Overview

ldapr is a system for
[LDAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol)
authentication in R. It acts as a wrapper around
[lidlap](https://www.openldap.org/software/man.cgi?query=ldap) to
provide a central authentication mechanism to R products. The primary
goal is to provide an LDAP client to shiny applications that require
authentication.

## Installation

For now this package is only available from GitHub.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("liamgilbey/ldapr")
```
